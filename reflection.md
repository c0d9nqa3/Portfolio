# Reflection

Using V0.dev to build my personal portfolio was a smooth and empowering experience. I was able to describe the layout and design of my website in natural language, and quickly receive working React and Tailwind CSS code that used ShadCN UI components.

This process changed how I think about frontend development. Instead of coding every element from scratch, I focused on communicating design intentions clearly and iteratively refining the output. I learned that well-structured prompts—such as specifying padding, layout changes, or hover effects—are essential to getting meaningful results from the AI.

The iterative workflow allowed me to test and refine ideas quickly. For example, I improved the hero section’s typography and alignment, adjusted the project cards’ layout and spacing for responsiveness, and added interactivity with hover animations. Each prompt gave me clean, production-ready code that I could immediately reuse or customize.

Another key takeaway was the importance of component structure. By asking V0 to break the design into reusable components, I was able to organize my project logically and make future updates easier. The output followed modern React and Tailwind best practices, which also helped me understand how to structure real-world UI codebases.

Overall, this project taught me how to work more efficiently with AI tools, think more clearly about design systems, and build high-quality web interfaces with less manual effort. It was not just about writing code—it was about thinking, planning, and iterating collaboratively with AI. I will definitely apply this approach in future personal and professional projects.
