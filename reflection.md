# Reflection

Using V0.dev to build my personal portfolio was a smooth and empowering experience. I was able to describe the layout and design of my website in natural language, and quickly receive working React and Tailwind CSS code that used ShadCN UI components.

Through multiple iterations, I learned how to effectively communicate design ideas to an AI, break down large changes into specific prompts, and refine the structure of my codebase into clean, reusable components. The AI helped me focus on higher-level decisions, while still giving me control over the final output. This project made me realize the practical value of AI-assisted development, especially for rapid prototyping and learning new frameworks.
