# Weijia Yan - Portfolio Website

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI, created with the help of V0.dev — an AI-based UI generation tool.

## Features

- Hero Section: Your name, profession, and call-to-action
- Projects Section: Three featured projects with title, description, and image
- Contact Section: Email, GitHub, and LinkedIn links
- Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile
- Tailwind CSS and ShadCN: Professional UI components and utility-first styling
- Component Structure: Built with reusable React components

## Built with V0.dev

This project was AI-assisted. I used natural-language prompts in V0.dev to:
- Generate the initial layout
- Iteratively improve styling and layout
- Break down the UI into reusable components

Prompt history and reflection are available in this repository.
