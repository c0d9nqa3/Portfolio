<pre lang="md"> # Iteration Prompts with V0.dev This document outlines the prompt history and results during the development of my AI-assisted portfolio website using V0.dev. --- ### ✅ Prompt 1: Initial Layout **Prompt**: ``` Create a responsive personal portfolio website using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components. The site should include: A hero section with the name “Ravi Yan”, role “Software Engineer”, and a call-to-action button “View My Work” A projects section with 3 projects. Each project has a title, a short description, and a placeholder image A contact section with a heading, description, and an email link Layout should be stacked on mobile, and 2-column project layout on desktop ``` **Result**: A basic page was generated with: - HeroSection component - Projects section with 3 project cards in a responsive layout - Contact section with email --- ### ✅ Prompt 2: Typography & Alignment **Prompt**: ``` Make the hero section text larger and bolder. Use text-5xl for the name and text-2xl for the subtitle. Center the content. ``` **Result**: - Headline text was increased and centered using `text-5xl` and `text-2xl` - Layout visually improved and better emphasizes identity --- ### ✅ Prompt 3: Card Spacing & Layout **Prompt**: ``` Add padding and shadow to each project card. Display the cards in two columns on desktop, and stacked on mobile. ``` **Result**: - Added `p-6`, `shadow-md`, and `rounded-lg` to each card - Desktop layout now uses a 2-column grid with proper gap --- ### ✅ Prompt 4: Hover Effects **Prompt**: ``` Add a hover effect to project cards: scale up slightly and increase shadow on hover. ``` **Result**: - Project cards animate with `hover:scale-105` and `hover:shadow-xl` - Improves interactivity and visual polish --- ### ✅ Prompt 5: Component Breakdown **Prompt**: ``` Break this into reusable components: HeroSection, ProjectsSection, ProjectCard, ContactSection. ``` **Result**: - All major sections were split into reusable `.tsx` components - Structure now follows best practices for maintainability </pre>
